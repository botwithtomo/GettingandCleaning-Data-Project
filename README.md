# GettingandCleaning-Data-Project
# I try so hard to do this project
there are two data sets train and test, x refers to the data, y refers to which type of activity 
there are also another txt file contains the names of the variables
we just simply combine them together
and only get those naems that contain mean and std
and then to creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
